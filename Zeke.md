I watch you as you calmly lie  
all crooked of paw and closed of eye  
your air of nonchalance belies  
the blur of waiting motion’s wind  
to feral feline’s darkened mind.  

In hugging tight to body curves  
invoking times of midnight purrs  
perhaps you deftly duel with curs  
or dance in dreams with carpet furs  
ensconced in play as I with words.  

Til woken by some silent sound  
you like a coiled spring unbound  
and arched like sapling west wind blown  
now vanish, wraithlike to the ground  
eloping shadows, tail unwound.
