# Eight Circle Road

Pebbles from your driveway  
were my birthright:  
smooth little creatures  
children of a heavy house that  
once child’s playground  
now stands open  
blowing in memory’s wind.  


I flew with your dreams  
as you slumbered your gentle way  
amid cicada song and window fan  
and vampiric,  
were consumed  
by the heat of the sun.  


Immutable, you were forever  
what you were:  
two attic rooms  
opposite in polarity  
that none of us ever fully explored  
and a forgotten cup which  
after being set down  
sat patiently  
waiting to be rediscovered  
until the following spring.  


Walking your halls through years  
I can trace them now  
in the recesses of my mind  
and feel the splinters  
we used to get  
from roughshod wooden floors:  
a rite of passage  
through barefoot running.  


We lived inside your art and dust  
as if inside the whale  
and played ping pong sometimes  
in the intestines of the beast:  
tiny balls ringing  
through echoes and valleys  
of forgotten power tools.  


I slid your bannister  
at an age too young for cliches  
and roamed the tangled garden  
that your lives built  
looking for a path that I created  
due to its conspicuous absence.  


Bedding down with ghosts  
I watched the walls move  
possessed with captured muse  
or the occasional lilac paint chip  
and slept the heavy sleep of boys  
who’ve wandered well that day.  


Your studio was guarded by  
beads that twinkled:  
marking the occasion of entrance  
to inner sanctum.  


I will go there now to sit  
amid mouldering houseplants  
and see if I can finish  
the canvas  
that you left behind.
