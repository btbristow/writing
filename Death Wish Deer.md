# Death Wish Deer

When it happened  
I was sitting in our dusty grey Celica  
feeling the Montana night highway  
thrum by under me.  
The road’s day – glo ribbon  
stretched out to infinity  
on either side  
the dark presence of the fields  
broken with an occasional  
yellow splotch of window.  
It seemed that  
we were the only creatures left  
in an empty, silent world.  

It was then that he came out  
into the road  
and stood there outlined  
in golden light  
with eyes of car fire.  
His antlers crowned him for  
he faced us down like a king  
making it clear  
that he owned the night  
far more than we did.  

We skidded to a stop  
inches from him, but  
he didn’t move.  
Then, warning accomplished  
he turned  
and in one movement  
cloaked himself in darkness  
leaving for an instant  
an incandescent white tail  
that seemed to be  
his innocence.  

In our need to make  
something funny  
of the situation,  
we called him the death wish deer.
