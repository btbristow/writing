#Brightonpier

**I**

As sun fills swollen, muzzy eyes  
cold rumbletrucks, highway–bound

streak through jet–lagged, foreign dawn.

Beachkilled vessel looms immense  
and dwarfs small boy from morning fog

only now an anchor to honor her.

On Brightonpier I began to carve  
and grainwise, shall work through the day  

slowly uncovering what Silver said  
hides in each driftwood along these shores:  

The true shape.

**II**

How many cups of coffee are along the way?  
How many newspapers?

Countless in their insignificance, my friend.

As  Redwing hawk flies updraft, soaring  
we shall drink and read, flitting fireflies

who Icarian, plunge earthward in a rain.

I breath warm smoke from a dark street’s silence  
while looking on brown timerock

baked and warmed by the noon sun.

The larger shape is looming now:  
like that wreck it is born from the void.

Still, I will toil deliberate  
in slow, gentle strokes that belie

indelibility of the ink that we leave
  
lifecarving.

**III**

I used to take this train to Chambers but  
I will never take that train again.

Just as I took it past Franklin, Park and all the others  
counting down stops to Brightonpier, there to play

a game of toy boats and spy the Isle of Wight

it took me to Piccadilly's light  
address book left on top of a phone booth.

Is it still there, a book of ghosts in a foreign station?

Or has it now joined you  
one eye brown and one blue,

in a place of lonely socks and things  
that can never be found again?

**IV**

Somewhere in Atlantic dusk  
small ferry chugs through golden arch

that serves to split both dark and dusk,  
illustration of duality.

I am no more finished than I could ever be:  
always, never and then forever I will be finished but

there is nonetheless, something now of  
the true shape within.

As a dusty grey Celica races through Montana night  
towards its appointment with a death wish deer,

I think I’ll moonrise from Brightonpier and  
like small boy gazed abandoned cargo line

I will stand with greying hair windblown  

on Brightonpier
  
the place where all roads meet.
