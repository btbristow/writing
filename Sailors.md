# Sailors

I watch her  
weatherbeaten  
knit hat  
against the cold  
grandmother surely  
by the way  
she tolerates  
their antics  
with smiling grace  
shepherds her charges  
along the pitching bus  
ensconces them carefully  
so they will not fall and  
she props them up.  

They lean against heavy hands  
glassy-eyed sailors lulled by  
a rocking ship  
abscond in seconds  
effortlessly and  
I envy them  
the simplicity of  
their escape.  

Later we dive  
to the curb  
they are handed  
down the steps and  
she fusses  
straightening  
red and blue snowsuits  
while they stand  
spaghetti-like.  

When I was that high  
already practiced  
in the art of insomnia  
I would lie awake and  
back to the wall  
guard my block city  
from cat burglars until  
near dawn  
sleep snuck up  
unwelcome  
and dragged me down  

Tonight I will not imitate  
their quick descent but  
the bouncing words of  
a  jesus preacher  
on the train today  
which tried to burst  
subway walls asunder  
and failing  
caromed instead  
off deaf ears and stone faces.
